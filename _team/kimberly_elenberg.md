Over the course of my 28-year career providing execution and oversight of continental U.S. emergency response missions, including mass casualty events and coordinating International Health Diplomacy missions, my contributions as a public health informaticist have been multifaceted. At the core, my work has been the embodiment of translational research, consistently bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in disaster response and healthcare. Previously aligned to the Department of Defense (DoD) Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence (CDAO), as the Principal Strategist for Incident Response, my research is grounded in the reality of healthcare delivery, making insights and innovations directly relevant and immediately applicable to those on the front lines. As a functional subject matter expert, I have fostered collaboration with technical experts across vital public health domains such as emergency response and dynamic operational logistics. This collaborative spirit has been pivotal in advancing the field, integrating diverse expertise to tackle complex health challenges.

In the realm of machine learning and data analysis, I have actively worked with research teams to develop and refine machine learning algorithms and data structures that enhance probabilistic modeling and predictive analysis. These collective efforts have been central to uncovering informative patterns within vast troves of sparse, noisy, and multivariate data—a task crucial for informed decision making. Moreover, efficient algorithms and data representation techniques significantly improve the speed and reliability of sophisticated analyses necessary for saving lives.
